    abstract = { Genome sequence data are now being routinely obtained from many nonmodel organisms. These data contain a wealth of information about the demographic history of the populations from which they originate. Many sophisticated statistical inference procedures have been developed to infer the demographic history of populations from this type of genomic data. In this review, we discuss the different statistical methods available for inference of demography, providing an overview of the underlying theory and logic behind each approach. We also discuss the types of data required and the pros and cons of each method. We then discuss how these methods have been applied to a variety of nonmodel organisms. We conclude by presenting some recommendations for researchers looking to use genomic data to infer demographic history. }

@article{andrews2016radseq,
abstract = {RADseq has fuelled studies in ecological, evolutionary and conservation genomics by using next-generation sequencing to uncover hundreds or thousands of polymorphic loci across the genome in a single, simple and cost-effective experiment. RADseq does not require any prior genomic information for the taxa being studied, and is therefore particularly advantageous for studies of non-model organisms.Numerous technical variations on RADseq have been developed, which promise to increase the flexibility and decrease the cost and effort of genomics studies. Differences among the methods lead to important considerations for all steps of genomics studies, from the types of scientific questions that can be addressed and the costs of library preparation and sequencing to the types of bias and error that are inherent in the resulting data.Allele dropout, PCR duplicates and variance in depth of coverage among loci are important sources of error and bias in RADseq studies, and the prevalence of these phenomena will vary across RADseq methods.Other important considerations when designing a RADseq study include the number, length and coverage of loci needed to address the research question; the availability of prior genomic resources; the budget; and the consistency of data across sequencing runs and laboratories.There is no single best or most flexible RADseq method. Researchers must consider the trade-offs of the different methods, and choose the approach that is best suited to their study goals.},

	abstract = {The genetic study of diverging, closely related populations is required for basic questions on demography and speciation, as well as for biodiversity and conservation research. However, it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to separation or whether populations have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci. These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged \~{}500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow since the initial separation of the species, with considerable variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between the species.},

	Abstract = {Author summary Sexually reproducing organisms are related to the others in their species by the complex web of parent-offspring relationships that constitute the pedigree. In this paper, we describe a way to record all of these relationships, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space. Storing this information allows us to produce whole-genome sequence from simulations of large populations in which we have not explicitly recorded new genomic mutations; we find that this results in computational run times of up to 50 times faster than simulations forced to explicitly carry along that information.},

	Abstract = {Accurately inferring the genome-wide landscape of recombination rates in natural populations is a central aim in genomics, as patterns of linkage influence everything from genetic mapping to understanding evolutionary history. Here we describe ReLERNN, a deep learning method for accurately estimating a genome-wide recombination landscape using as few as four samples. Rather than use summaries of linkage disequilibrium as its input, ReLERNN considers columns from a genotype alignment, which are then modeled as a sequence across the genome using a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that ReLERNN improves accuracy and reduces bias relative to existing methods and maintains high accuracy in the face of demographic model misspecification. We apply ReLERNN to natural populations of African Drosophila melanogaster and show that genome-wide recombination landscapes, while largely correlated among populations, exhibit important population-specific differences. Lastly, we connect the inferred patterns of recombination with the frequencies of major inversions segregating in natural Drosophila populations.},

	abstract = {The effect of a mutation on fitness may differ between populations, depending on environmental and genetic context. Experimental studies have shown that such differences exist, but little is known about the broad patterns of such differences or the factors that drive them. To quantify genome-wide patterns of differences in mutation fitness effects, we extended the concept of a distribution of fitness effects (DFE) to a joint DFE between populations. To infer the joint DFE, we fit parametric models that included demographic history to genomic data summarized by the joint allele frequency spectrum. Using simulations, we showed that our approach is statistically powerful and robust to many forms of model misspecification. We then applied our approach to populations of Drosophila melanogaster, wild tomatoes, and humans. We found that mutation fitness effects are overall least correlated between populations in tomatoes and most correlated in humans, corresponding to overall genetic differentiation. In D. melanogaster and tomatoes, mutations in genes involved in immunity and stress response showed the lowest correlation of fitness effects, consistent with environmental influence. In D. melanogaster and humans, deleterious mutations showed a lower correlation of fitness effects than tolerated mutations, hinting at the complexity of the joint DFE. Together, our results show that the joint DFE can be reliably inferred and that it offers extensive insight into the genetics of population divergence.},

	abstract = {Recent genome sequencing studies with large sample sizes in humans have discovered a vast quantity of low-frequency variants, providing an important source of information to analyze how selection is acting on human genetic variation. In order to estimate the strength of natural selection acting on low-frequency variants, we have developed a likelihood-based method that uses the lengths of pairwise identity-by-state between haplotypes carrying low-frequency variants. We show that in some non-equilibrium populations (such as those that have had recent population expansions) it is possible to distinguish between positive or negative selection acting on a set of variants. With our new framework, one can infer a fixed selection intensity acting on a set of variants at a particular frequency, or a distribution of selection coefficients for standing variants and new mutations. We apply our method to the UK10K phased haplotype dataset of 3,781 individuals and find a similar proportion of neutral, moderately deleterious, and deleterious variants compared to previous estimates made using the site frequency spectrum. We discuss several interpretations for this result, including that selective constraints have remained constant over time.},

Here we introduce a unified population-genetic and machine-learning model, called L inear A llele- S pecific S election I nferenc E ( LASSIE ), for estimating the fitness effects of all potential single-nucleotide variants, based on polymorphism data and predictive genomic features. We applied LASSIE to 51 high-coverage genome sequences annotated with 33 genomic features, and constructed a map of allele-specific selection coefficients across all protein-coding sequences in the human genome. We show that this map is informative about both human evolution and disease.},

@article{Boyko:2008cr,
abstract = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29{\%} of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (vertical bar s vertical bar {\textless} 0.01{\%}), 30-42{\%} are moderately deleterious (0.01{\%}, vertical bar s vertical bar, 1{\%}), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (vertical bar s vertical bar. 1{\%}). Our results are consistent with 10-20{\%} of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

@article{Barroso2019,
abstract = {Understanding the causes and consequences of recombination landscape evolution is a fundamental goal in genetics that requires recombination maps from across the tree of life. Such maps can be obtained from population genomic datasets, but require large sample sizes. Alternative methods are therefore necessary to research organisms where such datasets cannot be generated easily, such as non-model or ancient species. Here we extend the sequentially Markovian coalescent model to jointly infer demography and the spatial variation in recombination rate. Using extensive simulations and sequence data from humans, fruit-flies and a fungal pathogen, we demonstrate that iSMC accurately infers recombination maps under a wide range of scenariosÐremarkably, even from a single pair of unphased genomes. We exploit this possibility and reconstruct the recombination maps of ancient hominins. We report that the ancient and modern maps are correlated in a manner that reflects the established phylogeny of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern human populations.},
